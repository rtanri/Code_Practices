            <h1>OKINAWA: A SELF-DRIVE ROAD-TRIP TO THE "RUNT OF THE LITTER"</h1>

            <p>When people talk about going to Japan, it’s always the usual suspects: Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and some other well-known prefectures or cities. Okinawa, often the “runt of the litter”, turned out to be every bit as wonderful, if not, more charming with the amalgamation of influences from China, Taiwan, the US, and of course, Japan.</p>

            <h2>THE RYUKYU KINGDOM</h2>
            
            <p>Closer to Taiwan than to mainland Japan, Okinawa of old is actually the Ryukyu Kingdom, a tributary state to ancient (or not so ancient? Can’t remember) China. The Japanese later came in, annexed the island, and used it as a proxy to trade with China. The island was also a major battlefront between the Japanese and the US troops during WW2. After the war, the US occupied Okinawa for close to three decades before returning the island back to Japan. As a result, there’s a significant amount of Americans living in Okinawa.</p>
